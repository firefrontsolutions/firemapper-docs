Export KML/KMZ File
---------------
Exports the map as a KML/KMZ file. This format is used by most GIS applications including Google Earth. 

.. note:: FireMapper tries to format kml maps with similar line styles, however some line styles can not be reproduced in KML. The KML/KMZ format only supports solid lines. Dotted, dashed or other line styles are not supported. This is a limitation of the KML/KMZ format, not FireMapper.
